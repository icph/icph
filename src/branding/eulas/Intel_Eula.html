                <h3>License Restrictions.</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>General.</strong> Customer's rights set forth above will be limited to the right to copy and distribute the Software: (1) for Customer’s internal business use, and (2) to distribute the Software only when inseparably embedded in and marketed together as a Combined Offering in a single unit and subject to an End User License Agreement. Customer will not distribute the Software or any portion thereof on a standalone basis. Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, Customer has no rights to receive any Source Code of any Software except to the extent provided by Intel in Intel’s sole discretion. Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, Customer will not copy the Software or any related Documentation in whole or in part; and will not alter, modify, enhance, adapt, create derivative works of the Software. Customer will not, nor will it allow a third party to decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise attempt to learn the design, structure, algorithms, ideas or Source Code of the Software or products delivered by Intel; or rent, lease or otherwise provide temporary access to the Software. Customer will not sublicense any of the rights granted to Customer in Section 2. Customer will not alter or remove any of Intel’s or Intel Licensors’ copyright or proprietary rights notices or legends appearing on or in the Software. Customer will reproduce such notices on any copies of the Software Customer is permitted to make. All right, title and interest in and to the Software and Documentation are and will remain the exclusive property of Intel and its Licensors. An essential basis of the bargain in this Agreement is that no licenses or other rights, including but not limited to patent and copyright licenses or rights, are granted to Customer by implication, estoppel or otherwise, except for the licenses expressly granted in Section 2. Specifically, except for the licenses expressly granted in Section 2, no licenses or other rights are granted by Intel or its Licensors, expressly or by implication, estoppel or otherwise: (1) to make, use, sell, offer for sale, or import modifications of the Software or Documentation; (2) to sell or offer to sell the Software or Documentation; (3) to combine the Software or modified versions of the Software with other items or to use any such combination, or (4) to any claims of any patents, patent applications, or other patent rights of Intel or its Licensors other than the Licensed Patent Claims. The consideration provided under this Agreement is only for the licenses expressly granted to Customer in Section 2. Any other rights, including but not limited to additional patent rights, would require an additional license and additional consideration. Nothing in this Agreement requires or will be treated to require Intel to grant any such additional license. Although Customer will set the price of a Combined Offering in its sole discretion, the Software may not be advertised or offered for a price separate from the price offered for the Combined Offering. Customer may not distribute the Combined Offering by electronic distribution. Customer will not alter or remove any of Intel’s or Intel Licensors’ copyright or proprietary rights notices or legends appearing on or in the Software. Customer will reproduce such notices on any copies of the Software Customer is permitted to make. There are no implied patent licenses or other licenses under this Agreement, and any rights not expressly granted to Customer hereunder are reserved by Intel. Intel and Intel Licensors retain full title to Software and all copies thereof.</li>
                    <li><strong>End User License Agreement.</strong> Customer will inform all End Users of the restrictions set forth in this Agreement with respect to use of the Software. Customer will require End Users of the Combined Offering to execute the End User License Agreement (attached as Exhibit A). Depending on the nature of the Combined Offering, execution by the End User may be achieved through manually or electronically signed, “shrink wrap” or “click-through” forms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Responsibilities.</strong> Customer will be solely responsible for the integration of the Software into the Combined Offering. Customer will be solely responsible to deliver the Combined Offering to End Users, and for installing or enabling the Combined Offering to run on or interoperate with End User’s equipment. Customer will, at its sole cost make exact copies of the Software, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Intel.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Third Party Software.</strong> Elements of the Software may contain or be derived from materials of third party licensors (“Third Party Software”).

Such terms may include, but are not limited to, the Eclipse Public License, the Academic Free License, the Apache Software License, the Artistic License, the BSD License, the Mozilla Public License and/or the Python License “Free” or “Open Source” Software, to include programs and code that are licensed under a GNU license, are specifically excluded from all obligations, including without limitation indemnities, licenses, warranty and support obligations described elsewhere in this Agreement. Unless expressly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement, Customer may not use, combine or distribute any portion of the software that is not already subject to an OSS license in any manner that would cause the Software, or any portion of the Software, to become subject to the terms of any open source license.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Authorized Subcontractor.</strong> Subject to Customer’s compliance with the notice and consent provisions of this Section 5, Intel grants Customer the right to authorize a subcontractor (“<strong><em>Authorized Subcontractor</em></strong>”) to use the Software solely in Object Code form for purposes of development of the Combined Offering and/or to manufacture the Combined Offering for Customer (the “<strong><em>Purpose</em></strong>”). Authorized Subcontractor will acquire no rights in the Software other than those expressly provided in this Section 5. Customer and Authorized Subcontractor will have a written agreement governing Authorized Subcontractor’s use of the Software, on terms at least as protective of the Software as the terms of this Agreement, including: (a) requiring the Authorized Subcontractor to use the Software solely for the Purpose; (b) to treat the Software as Confidential Information pursuant to the terms of Section 15 and (c) assign any and all rights in and to the Software and Modifications to Intel and its licensors.. Any breach by Authorized Subcontractor of its obligations under such agreement will also constitute a breach by Customer of this Agreement. Intel and its licensors will be specified as a third party beneficiary of the agreement between Authorized Subcontractor and Customer. Customer is fully responsible of the acts and omissions of its subcontractors.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Trademark Rights.</strong> Customer is not permitted to use the Intel Marks in connection with distributing the Software in accordance with this Agreement. The Intel Marks are the property of Intel. Customer will not attempt to register or register any Intel trademarks, trade names or logos, or any marks likely to cause confusion. Intel will have the sole right and discretion to bring, prosecute and settle infringement, unfair competition and similar proceedings based on the Intel trademark.

This warranty gives Customer specific legal rights and Customer may have other rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Limitation of Remedies and Damages.</strong> REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM FOR DAMAGES IS BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, IN NO EVENT SHALL INTEL OR ITS LICENSORS’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES EXCEED THAT PORTION OF THE FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY YOU FOR THE INTEL PRODUCT THAT ARE DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE VALUE OF THE AFFECTED SOFTWARE, AS DETERMINED BY INTEL IN ITS REASONABLE DISCRETION.
